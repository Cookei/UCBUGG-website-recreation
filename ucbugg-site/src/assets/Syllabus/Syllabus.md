# Course Description and Structure

- This course is intended for students who are interested in the prospect of learning the principles of 3D modeling and animation, and the process that goes into creating 3D animated movies.
- Students will be divided into project groups consisting of about 5-6 people. Groups will then spend the rest of the semester working to complete a roughly 30-second short film using Autodesk Maya.
- There are two distinct sections to this course, one on Monday and one on Wednesday. Students must register for one of these two sections, and then attend that section for the rest of the semester. Students will not be allowed to switch sections after registration.
- Every class will begin with a short lecture introducing a new concept of 3D animation. Students will then work through an online tutorial which will help them learn to put this new concept into practice. After completing this tutorial, students will be encouraged to work on their projects in class with the help of facilitators.
- In addition to class every week, there will be regular studio hours held in the Kresge Engineering Library, where facilitators will be available to provide feedback and answer any questions students may have concerning their projects.
- Grading is based on four components:
  - Homework submission
  - Peer evaluations, which are anonymously taken from the members of each group at the end of the course.
  - Attendance/Participation
  - Completion of final short
- Homework will be due at the beginning of class every week, and may include both individual assignments as well as assignments to be completed as a team. It is important that everyone take an active role to complete both types of assignments.

# Requirements and Prerequisites

- Enrollment will be based on an application which involves the submission of an initial homework assignment along with a form containing other relevant information about the student. The details of this assignment will be discussed in the introductory lecture.
- **Students must be fully enrolled both in this class and at UC Berkeley. Unfortunately, we cannot accept auditors.**
- It is highly recommended that students have access to a personal computer that can have Autodesk Maya installed on it. However, this is not a hard requirement as card key access to the Mac lab will be granted after registration as well.

# Grading and Absence Policy

This course can only be taken as PASS/NO PASS (P/NP). CCNs will be provided by the instructors during the second week of class.

- **Perform all the mandatory homework assignments**
- **Maximum of 3 absences, 1 unexcused**
- **Successfully interact with your group mates**
- **Complete the final project**
