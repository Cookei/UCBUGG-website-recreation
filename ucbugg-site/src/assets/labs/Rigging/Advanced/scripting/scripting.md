# INTRODUCTION

We will explore fundamental Maya Python scripting skills to help you create your very first custom tool not yet available in Maya. Specifically, we will develop a pivot snapping script that centers the pivot of one object onto another object's center. This tool will enable you to easily rotate a camera around an object or have other objects rotate around another object's central point.

We hope that you will find this script useful in your team's workflow!

> (!important)
> This lab assumes a basic understanding of Python 3.0+ (equivalent to Berkeley's [CS 10](https://cs10.org/),
>  [Data 8](https://www.data8.org/sp24/), or the first two weeks of [CS 61a](https://cs61a.org)).
> We will cover basic data types (ints, strings, booleans, lists), if statements, for loops, functions, and lambdas.
> Object-oriented programming is not covered.
