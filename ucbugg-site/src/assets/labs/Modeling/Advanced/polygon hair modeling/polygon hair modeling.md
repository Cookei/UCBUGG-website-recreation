# Polygon Hair Modeling

Welcome to the polygon hair modeling lab! There are quite a few different ways to model hair. Today, we're going to model it using polygons! Polygon hair makes a really stylized look that is perfect for anime or cutesy low-poly models (or if you don't want to deal with xgen).

In this lab, we're going to go over 3 different types of hair styles. Long hair, short hair, and braids. Although many things will be similar, we will be exploring different techniques to create the hair pieces.

For all of these sections, please download and reuse this anime head mesh, taken from Marfab.
